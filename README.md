# NSNSD Virtual Environments
A repository to implement versioning of Python virtual environments for specific NPS Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division software tools. The Anaconda `.yml` files  included here allow for rapid creation of identical environments - which will allow smoother, more coordinated use of our tools by many users. 

## NSNSDgeo

A Python 2.7, 64-bit geoprocessing environment that includes `gdal` and `rasterio`

## soundDB

A Python 3.5, 64-bit environment that includes `soundDB` and `iyore`. Keeps `pandas=0.19`.

## arcpy
